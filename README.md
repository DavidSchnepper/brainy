![Brainy](https://gitenterprise.inside-box.net/mbasta/brainy/raw/fixes/documentation/brainy.png)

Brainy is a replacement for the popular [Smarty](http://www.smarty.net/)
templating language. It is a fork from the Smarty 3 trunk.


## Why Brainy?

- Brainy generates cleaner and faster code than Smarty by default.
- Brainy removes features that are infrequently used and increase code bloat.
  Brainy's feature set promotes best practices and discourages hacks.
- Brainy is safer than Smarty in that it removes support for features like
  `eval` and injecting arbitrary PHP into a template.


## Minimum Requirements

- PHP 5.3 or higher
- (optionally) HHVM 3.1.x or higher

Unlike Smarty 3, PHP 5.2.x is not a supported platform. Use Brainy with old
versions of PHP at your own risk.

Note that HHVM support is currently experimental, though most common behaviors
work as expected.


## Getting Started

Check out the [Getting Started](https://gitenterprise.inside-box.net/mbasta/brainy/wiki/Getting-Started)
page on the wiki.


## Working on Brainy

For information on how to set up a local dev environment and run the tests,
see the wiki page on [Hacking on Brainy](https://gitenterprise.inside-box.net/mbasta/brainy/wiki/Hacking-on-Brainy).


## Differences from Smarty

While Brainy will work as a drop-in replacement for Smarty in most
applications, there are some differences that may make it difficult to switch.

A complete list of incompatibilities is listed [on the wiki](https://gitenterprise.inside-box.net/mbasta/brainy/wiki/Smarty-Incompatibilities).


### Added Features

- `stripwhitespace` filter: This functions similarly to `trimwhitespace`, but does not strip HTML comments and does not account for HTML elements like `<pre>` or `<textarea>`. For many applications, these features are not necessary and using `stripwhitespace` instead of `trimwhitespace` can greatly improve performance.
- The `Smarty` class has a `safe_lookups` member that gives control over Brainy's behavior when an undefined variable or array value is accessed.


## Where is Brainy headed?

- **Phase 1**: Provide a clean, drop-in replacement for Smarty that generates
  cleaner code and increases code quality.
- **Phase 2**: Provide a backwards-compatible interface for allowing templates
  to compile asynchronously.
- **Phase 3**: Allow templates to be compiled to [Hack](http://hacklang.org/)
  and add full async support.

### Requested Contributions

If you're interested in helping out, the following tasks are available:

- Convert all non-public methods to use camel case.
- Add proper type annotations to all functions.
- Remove magic and bad practices.
  - Variable variables
  - `__call`, `__get`, etc.
  - Eliminate dead code
  - `@` error suppression
  - etc.
- Remove workarounds for unsupported versions of PHP.

At the time of writing, the project has approximately 68% line coverage.
