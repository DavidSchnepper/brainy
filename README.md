# Brainy

Brainy is a replacement for the popular [Smarty](http://www.smarty.net/)
templating language. It is a fork from the Smarty 3 trunk.

Brainy is still very new and it's likely that you will encounter some issues.
Please report any problems that you encounter.


## Why Brainy?

- Brainy generates cleaner and faster code than Smarty by default.
- Brainy has security defaults that align better with [best practices](http://www.phptherightway.com/#security).
- Brainy removes features that are infrequently used and increase code bloat.
- Brainy is safer than Smarty in that it removes support for features like
  `eval` and injecting arbitrary PHP into a template. Brainy uses less PHP magic.


## Getting Started

Check out the [Getting Started](https://github.com/box/brainy/wiki/Getting-Started)
page on the wiki.


### Minimum Requirements

- PHP 5.3.2 or higher
- (optionally) HHVM 3.1.x or higher

Unlike Smarty 3, PHP 5.2.x is not a supported platform. Use Brainy with old
versions of PHP at your own risk.

Note that HHVM support is currently experimental, though most common behaviors
work as expected.


### Differences from Smarty

While Brainy will work as a drop-in replacement for Smarty in most
applications, there are some differences that may make it difficult to switch.

A complete list of differences is listed [on the wiki](https://github.com/box/brainy/wiki/Differences-from-Smarty).


## Contributing to Brainy

### Requested Contributions

If you're interested in helping out, pull requests for the following tasks will be warmly welcomed:

- Convert all non-public methods to use camel case.
- Add proper PHPDoc annotations to all functions and methods.
- Remove magic and bad practices:
  - `__call`, `__get`, etc.
